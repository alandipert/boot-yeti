# boot-yeti example project

This is a tiny factorial calculator project based on an
[example in the Yeti tutorial](http://dot.planet.ee/yeti/intro.html#public-classes).

Compile the project:

    boot build

Run:

    java -jar target/yeti-example-1.0.0.jar 5

**Note: The Yeti compiler only seems to work on Java 7.**
