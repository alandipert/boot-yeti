# boot-yeti

A work-in-progress [Boot] task for compiling [Yeti] programs.  See
`example/` for how to use it.

> Note: The Main class in the example project I copied from [the tutorial](http://dot.planet.ee/yeti/intro.html#public-classes) currently explodes; I have an email out to the yeti mailing list about it.
